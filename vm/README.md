# Virtual Machines

The [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) defines a
virtual machine as:

_In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system.
Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality
of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware,
software, or a combination._

In this study we will focus on software based virtual machines for the
W65C02S processor in the Commander X 16 neo-retro computer.

The above definition states that a virtual machine allows one computer system
to emulate another. What it does not mention is that the machine being emulated
may not actually exist. It is possible, and often desirable to emulate machines
that are in fact purely hypothetical in nature. This can allow the emulation
of a processor more ideally suited to a specific task than any "real" system.
