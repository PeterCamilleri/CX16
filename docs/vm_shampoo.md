# VM Shampoo Summary

In this section, we are going to look at the options we've examined so
far and see how they fit into the virtual machine (VM) shampoo loop. If
you need a refresher on that loop, here is what has to happen for each
VM instruction executed:

<pre><code>fetch &rarr; decode &rarr; execute &rarr; repeat</code></pre>

Since they differ so much, we will further divide our summary into the byte
coded and threaded VM design philosophies.
