## Introduction

To start, I will admit that this project has more than its share of me
rambling on with my thoughts and opinions. In this section, I try to distil
the relevant lessons learned from my over 40 years experience in
programming.

Besides, this is my project! I get to speak here! If you want your voice
heard, create your own project. Or, raise an issue in this project and your
thoughts and questions will be addressed. As the code of conduct mentions,
this is an open and inclusive project. All are welcome.
