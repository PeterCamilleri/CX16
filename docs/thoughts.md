## Introduction

To start, I will admit that this project has more than its share of me
rambling on with my thoughts and opinions. In this section, I try to distil
the relevant lessons learned from my over 40 years experience in
programming.

Besides, this is my project! I get to speak here! If you want your voice
heard, create your own project. Or, raise an issue in this project and your
thoughts and questions will be addressed. As the code of conduct mentions,
this is an open and inclusive project. All are welcome.

## Modular Programming

In many older languages, like early versions BASIC or assembly, code was
contained in a single source file. If the program got big, that single
source file got big too. In fact it got HUGE. Keeping ideas and concepts
clear was tricky, especially since comments ("rem" statements) consumed
precious memory space. Sharing code was difficult as code libraries had to
be "pasted" into programs manually and integrated somehow. As a result,
code libraries were rare beyond routines stored in system ROM that were
application accessible.

Later languages included a linker to bring code from multiple sources and
libraries together. Languages included features to export and import various
attributes of the code. This allowed shared code. More importantly, it
allowed a large program, filled with complex ideas, to be broken down into
smaller chinks, with simpler, more easily understood ideas.
